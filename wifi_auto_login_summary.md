## ‚úÖ Development Summary (English)

### üéØ Objective:
Build a script that automatically logs into the campus WiFi authentication system after connecting, eliminating the need for manual input.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps:

1. **Requirements Clarified**
   - Student WiFi requires login after connection
   - Login page appears as a browser captive portal

2. **Initial Packet Capture Attempts**
   - Tried Fiddler on Windows, but was already logged in
   - Restarted PC, tried with iPhone proxy, but no login page shown

3. **Network Scan**
   - Built a Python scanner to scan local network `10.25.32.0/20`
   - Tested HTTP/HTTPS ports using multithreading, no login page found

4. **Login Page Captured**
   - Successfully triggered captive portal in browser
   - Login URL: `https://secure.vcccd.edu/guest/student.php?cmd=login`

5. **Captured POST Request**
   - Used Fiddler to capture POST data including:
     - `username`, `password`, `accept`, `url`, `apname`, `apgroup`, `essid`, `ip`

6. **Implemented Auto Login Script**
   - Used Python `requests` to simulate login
   - Script performs one-click authentication

7. **Test & Validation**
   - Verified working when disconnected from network
   - Ready for packaging as `.exe` and setting up as a startup task
